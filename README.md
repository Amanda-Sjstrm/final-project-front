# Overall idea

I'm planning to create a web app called that will allow users to search for hiking trails on a map, save routes they like, and share photos of their hikes.

The app will have a clean, intuitive interface that will let users quickly find hiking trails in their area or in other locations they're interested in. Users will be able to filter their search results by difficulty level, length, and other criteria, and they'll be able to rate save their favourite routes to their profile for easy access later.

The app will also allow users to upload photos of their hikes and share them with other users. This will create a community of hikers who can connect with each other, share tips and advice, and inspire each other to explore new trails.

I plan to use React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, along with the TomTom navigation API for the map functionality. I'm confident that I can build a high-quality app that will be both functional and visually appealing, and that will provide real value to hikers and outdoor enthusiasts.
